In July 2020 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53417948) on the rate of insolvencies and the changing status of companies during the coronavirus pandemic. The analysis suggests there may be many companies now operating as so-called "zombie companies": businesses that function day-to-day, but cannot pay off the full debt they owe or find cash to invest and grow.

The BBC Shared Data Unit looked at how many companies had posted insolvency notices in the London Gazette, the official paper of record for public notices. A company is insolvent when it can't pay its debts.

Our investigation found there was a spike of 4,200 insolvencies in March as the UK headed into lockdown.
